Wesley Hymnal Processor is a program designed to allow
for the easy creation of church hymnals using the ABC
music typesetting language. Hymns are input into files
using Wesley's special notation, a format file is
created specifying how Wesley should format the hymns,
and a file is created listing all the hymns Wesley should
operate on.

Wesley is currently in pre-pre-pre-ALPHA stages. We are
currently working on documentation and development as
we go. It is not recommended to use Wesley at this time.
